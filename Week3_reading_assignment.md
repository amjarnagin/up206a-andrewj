## Geoff Boeing's "Off the Grid…and Back Again? The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning and Design"
Geoff Boeing’s “Off the Grid…and Back Again?” documents trends in street design across the U.S. over time. Broadly, changes in street design match our understanding of historical changes in land use, urban form, and transportation. American cities built before the automobile exhibit denser street networks characterized by straight lines, internally consistent orientation, and many four-way intersections. This design favors pedestrians and early forms of public transportation. As population growth moved to newly-built, car-centric suburbs, these areas’ streets were designed with less connectivity, more curves and circuitous routes, and fewer intersections. Since 2000, with the rise of urbanist ideals, transit-oriented development, and redevelopment projects in cities and some suburbs, street design has trended back toward the classic grid system. Street networks, by nature, are very difficult to retrofit, except in cases of greenfield development and infill, and thus planners who are seeking to shift from car-centric land use should take advantage of these opportunities to implement more-gridded streets.

A street network’s level of griddedness is not an absolute determinant of transportation or land use, but significantly influences residential patterns and mode suitability. From a simple mathematical perspective, gridded designs favor walking and public transit by providing more direct routes, efficient coverage of a larger service area, and more legibility in unfamiliar locations, as compared to indirect, suburban cul-de-sac style of streets.

Beyond the scope of this article’s analysis, I am curious about the role of diagonals in grid systems. Washington, DC, for example, has diagonal avenues named after states that cut across its grid. As a pedestrian, these streets significantly shorten distances, but also create more complicated intersections, often managed through roundabounts. I’d also like to know more about decisions are made about street layout in hilly areas. The article briefly mentions that greater topographical variation is associated with less griddedness (except for San Francisco), but begs the question of whether straighter streets with greater elevation changes or less-direct routes that preserve a flatter walk are preferable for users of various transportation modes. The preferences for speed vs. strenuousness are obviously different for everyone, and I would be interested to know how/if the competing alternatives are studied.

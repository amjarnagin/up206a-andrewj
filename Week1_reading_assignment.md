## Article Summary
This article delves into a crisis of unneeded amputations in Bolivar County, Mississippi and much of the Black Belt in the American South. The author profiles Dr. Foluso Fakorede, a cardiologist on a mission to fight back against what he describes as an epidemic of unnecessary amputations in the Mississippi Delta. Diabetic amputations are one of the most preventable surgeries, and a stunning rate of amputations, concentrated in poor, Black, rural communities in the South is driven by a toxic combination of disinvestment in public health, insurer guidelines, inadequate preventative care, and good old fashioned American-style racism. he fates of several patients under Dr. Fakorede's care are detailed, along with his attempts to find alternatives to medically unjustified amputations, he has encountered resistance from local healthcare providers, insurers, and the medical establishment.

## Reflection
In a year filled with almost exclusively bad things, this article was one of the most horrifying things I read, though it aligns closely with what I know about the plight of healthcare in rural America, the cruel and inane outcomes of our insurance systems, and the human costs of right-wing policies at the state level. An effective visualization serves a greater purpose - it is not just a pretty image. I was struck by the fact that Dr. Fakorede routinely shows people the pair of maps in the article to illustrate the inspiration for his mission. Granted, these are not the most complex maps, nor does the underlying analysis demonstrate causation. But with an understanding of American history, it is impossible to ignore the graphics' implication. They also represent an unconventional pairing of datasets, and I found the comparison of amputations and enslaved population in 1860 to be a creative and powerful use of data to illustrate a pattern behind the specific story told about healthcare in the Mississippi Delta. The visualization does not serve to overpower or obscure the story being told about real people - rather, it begins to set these individual stories in the necessary context.

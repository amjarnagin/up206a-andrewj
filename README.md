# UP 206A GIS Data Science project introduction

UP 206A is the UCLA Urban Planning program's introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science using JupyterHub and Python-based spatial analysis libraries.

## Personal Introduction
I am a first-year MURP student at UCLA with a concentration in Transportation Policy and Planning. I am interested in the role of buses in urban transit systems, the potentials of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) as a viable mode for less-dense cities, and how racial politics affect local decisions regarding bus planning, funding, and service. I'm a new Angeleno, was raised in Atlanta, and previously lived in Washington, DC. I speak English, Arabic, and Spanish.

## My goals for this course:
* Learn how to find, identify, or create spatial data that can be used in GIS analysis
* Gain the skillset to analyze the spatial features of datasets to identify phenomena or trends that aren't immediately apparent
* Practice conveying the results of spatial data analysis in a clear, engaging, and informative format

## Project Idea
I want to look into some aspect of public transit via bus. Buses provide a transportation lifeline to many carless Americans, and the relatively poor service, travel speed, and amenities provided to bus riders is a direct consequence of political choices toward a transit mode that overwhelmingly serves Black, Latinx, and poor riders. To build an equitable, green, and effective transit system, quality bus service is a must, particularly in the American urban areas that lack the density needed to support heavy rail investments. For this project, I am potentially interested in studying patterns in bus travel speed, BRT corridors (existing or potential), or the condition of bus stops in relation to temperature and/or shade and tree cover.

Contingent on available data, I hope to compare Los Angeles and Atlanta. To my mind, the cities have many similarities and share challenges of addressing transportation and climate change-related issues without an ingrained public transit infrastructure and heavily suburban development patterns.
